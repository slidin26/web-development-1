          <h5>The age-old traditional craft which is simple yet marvellous.</h5>
          
          <p>This is amongst the oldest and most widespread form of handicrafts.
             Historical records of prehistoric era have been found in the remains of pottery.
              It is believed to have existed since 7000 BC in the Neolithic period.
               Apart from the popular terracotta or fired clay products,
                other products are the stoneware which are fired at over 1150 degree C.
                The translucent form, also known as porcelain is also very popular.
                 The raw material for this craft is ordinary clay, derived from
                  the beds of water bodies like river, lakes and ponds.
                   The clay is cleaned, mixed and ten shaped either by hand, 
                   wheel or molded into desired object. The items are dried,
                    fired and glazed as per the requirements.
                     The clay or terracotta products are graded according to their color,
                      strength and water absorption capacity.
                    
                      Terracotta female figurines were uncovered by archaeologists in excavations of Mohenjo-daro,
                         Pakistan (3000â€“1500 BC). Along with phallus-shaped stones, these suggest some sort of fertility
                          cult.[14] The Burney Relief is an outstanding terracotta plaque from Ancient
                           Mesopotamia of about 1950 BC. In Mesoamerica, the great majority of Olmec 
                           figurines were in terracotta. Many ushabti mortuary statuettes were also
                            made of terracotta in Ancient Greek terracotta figurine or Tanagra figurine, 2nd century BC; height: 29.2 cm
                        The Ancient Greeks' Tanagra figurines were mass-produced mold-cast and fired
                         terracotta figurines, that seem to have been widely affordable in the Hellenistic period,
                          and often purely decorative in function. They were part of a wide range of Greek terracotta
                           figurines, which included larger and higher-quality works such as the Aphrodite Heyl;
                            the Romans too made great numbers of small figurines, often religious.
                             Etruscan art often used terracotta in preference to stone even for larger statues,
                              such as the near life-size Apollo of Veii and the Sarcophagus of the Spouses.
                               Campana reliefs are Ancient Roman terracotta reliefs, originally mostly used
                                to make friezes for the outside of buildings, as a cheaper substitute for stone.</p>
